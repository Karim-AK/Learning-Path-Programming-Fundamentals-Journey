# My Programming Basics Journey

This repository documents my personal journey of learning **programming fundamentals**.  
It contains examples, exercises, and small programs that I wrote while studying the basics of C++ and other programming concepts.

## üìö What You'll Find Here
- Simple programs demonstrating programming basics (variables, conditions, loops, functions, enums, etc.).
- Gradual progression from beginner-level exercises to more advanced concepts.
- Well-commented code to make it easy for others to follow and learn.

## üéØ Purpose
The main goal of this repository is **learning** and **sharing knowledge**.  
It‚Äôs not a single project but a collection of code samples reflecting my growth as a programmer.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
- Browse the folders/files to see different topics and examples.
- Compile and run the code samples using any C++ compiler.
- Learn from the code or contribute by suggesting improvements.

## ‚ö° Example
One of the programs asks the user to enter a day number (1‚Äì7) and displays the corresponding day of the week ‚Äî showing how to use `enum`, functions, and input validation in C++.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g. g++, clang, MSVC).
- Basic understanding of how to compile and run C++ code.
